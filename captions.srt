1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
recording

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,000
and I would like to welcome everyone

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,000
again for joining us for this seminar on

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,279
the adversary engagement ontology

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,260
as uh as the announcement mentioned this

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:23,279
uh project is

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,880
a collaboration between miter say lab

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,660
and a number of other

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,600
organizations we just released the a

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,180
beta version of the address of

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,260
Engagement ontology and we hope that the

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,320
seminar today that's who's a talks today

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:47,399
will provide you with

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,500
some uh with an overview of why there is

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,940
a need for an adversary engagement

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,360
ontology

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,520
what is adversary engagement in terms of

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,320
cyber deception ending at all

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,399
and how

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,199
one might be able to leverage AEO

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,820
adversary engagement application

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,840
ontology

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:14,700
to attack at this engagement planning uh

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,500
operations and

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,340
uh

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,580
and uh intelligence collection after

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,720
operations after interactions today we

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,880
are lucky to have a wonderful lineup of

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,380
speakers

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,360
we have uh Maritza

31
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,479
Marvel

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,360
I hope I'm not mispronouncing uh her

33
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,560
name Marita is

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,500
uh from

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,520
the miter engage tune

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,200
after which uh Corey Hall the project

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,259
leader for cyber domain ontology will be

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,259
presenting an overview of what the Cyber

39
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,200
domain ontology the unified cyber

40
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:09,560
ontology and the application ontology

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:13,340
such as case and AE are all about

42
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:17,400
and this will be followed by a brief

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,280
introduction statement from Alex Nelson

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,980
from nest

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,280
who has been contributing to this

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,520
project uh with

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,800
uh who had quite a bit of valuable

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,480
feedback as well as guidance

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,540
and then

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,239
last but definitely not least

51
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,599
uh the sale team will be presenting the

52
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,200
adversary engagement ontology uh its

53
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:50,640
current version its structured and its

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,920
use case through example scenarios

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,959
now with that

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:02,459
um I would like to invite merita to

57
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:05,840
uh see if she can join her is share her

58
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:09,180
screen and do a quick sound check

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
can you hear me I can hear you can you

60
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,819
hear me

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,280
I think you need to give me permission

62
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,440
to share because uh disabled screen

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,900
sharing

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,500
it's now enabled

65
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,019
boom look at that okay hang on

66
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,459
and the floor is yours

67
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,459
can you see slide

68
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:36,060

knows just to let you know just delay uh

71
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,459
will be made up with the buffer time

72
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,220
we've added at the end of the schedule

73
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,340
so all of the presentations will retain

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,799
their original duration and length

75
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,560
perfect okay

76
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,860
um let me just all right hang up okay

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,580
all right so hi good morning everyone

78
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,260
um

79
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,659
I wanted to spend a few minutes today

80
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,400
talking a little bit about the way that

81
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:08,519
miter thinks about adversary engagement

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,019
and uh to talk a bit about the indeed

83
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,400
framework and

84
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,200
um where it came from and where we're

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,939
going with it and the resources that are

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,419
available through it so

87
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,699
um my name is I just got married that

88
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,500
might have known me as murder Market

89
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,940
um I switched because I forget half the

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,940
time what my new last name is um

91
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,979
so uh starting off with some definition

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,960
so the way that we Define all of these

93
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,120
various pieces is we like to talk about

94
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,020
revealing and concealing facts and

95
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,479
fiction

96
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,979
um this is a concept you

97
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,620
if you've cyber denial the question in

98
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,780
counter deception a book that came out

99
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,000
um a little ways back at this point they

100
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,860
have a great broad chart in there where

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,900
they really break out these concepts by

102
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,759
the same lines and so um we thought it

103
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,199
was really important to refer back to

104
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,240
that book and kind of make that the

105
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,979
basis of a lot of the things

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,139
um and how we talk about and how we

107
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,460
Define these various Concepts so um

108
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,500
quick shout out to that book and again

109
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,419
it's fiber denial question encounter

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,220
deception uh written by a number of

111
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,620
minor folks including Frank deck and

112
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,880
Kristen Heckman and Alex though and it's

113
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,220
a really great read and if you haven't

114
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,500
read it I highly recommend it so

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,139
starting with some definition so we talk

116
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,600
about fiber denial those are revealing

117
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,699
conviction to prevent or impair an

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,680
adversary of operation on the other side

119
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,960
of that we have private detection here

120
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,600
we're talking about feeling the fact in

121
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,060
fiction the mislead or confused and then

122
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,100
most importantly in from engages

123
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,380
perspective is taking these two things

124
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,360
together coupling them with strategic

125
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,060
planning and Analysis and talking about

126
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,220
that as adversary engagement and we

127
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,660
think this term is really important

128
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,759
um because one of the things we see all

129
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,320
the time is there's a lot of confusion

130
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,720
there's a lot of

131
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,880
um it's misunderstandings around the

132
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,800
word deception when you go into

133
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,560
government and DOD spaces military

134
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,199
deception as sort of very specific

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,880
meanings and very specific context in

136
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,039
the private sector you know there's a

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,680
lot of confusion with is deception lying

138
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,300
is deception uh misinformation right no

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
one wants to be on the cover of the

140
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,600
Washington Post

141
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,300
um with my company does misinformation

142
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,580
right that's not what anyone wants so

143
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,620
there's a lot of just um

144
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,720
like I said misunderstandings tracked

145
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,580
around using cyber deception and so for

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,740
this reason we really like to talk about

147
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,479
things as adversary engagement because

148
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,639
we feel like that really gets to the

149
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,740
heart of what we're trying to do and

150
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,660
also takes away some of that confusion

151
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,160
around the negativity associated with

152
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,860
perfection

153
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,720
so now that we've sort of defined

154
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,220
um the Nile interception and adversary

155
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,020
engagement talked about the concealing

156
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,520
and revealing fact I wanted to give a

157
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,139
couple of examples of what they could

158
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,940
really look like and what this means and

159
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,360
how this might show up in other things

160
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,000
outside of just the fiber Realm

161
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,740
a little there we go so um I can't see

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,880
anyone but we'll do a show in Virtual

163
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,020
hand

164
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,919
um even though I can't believe that's

165
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,740
okay

166
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,500
um who has ever put a this house

167
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,060
protected by or beware of Dom's fine out

168
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,620
front of their house

169
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,240
right so that's a great example of

170
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,699
revealing facts and telling something

171
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,340
that is true about that house or about

172
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,080
you know that business or whatever it is

173
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,940
what about put their lights on a timer

174
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,880
when they went on vacation or left music

175
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,259
playing when you left the house

176
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,780
well that's an example of revealing

177
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,400
effect no one's actually home but you're

178
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,599
in some way

179
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,280
um you know making it look like

180
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,500
someone's home I like to think about the

181
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,060
the scene in Home Alone when the they

182
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
set up that whole big party and they

183
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,639
have all the it looks like there's a

184
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,740
whole group of people in there and it's

185
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,680
just that one little kid

186
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,199
what about hidden a key in a fake rock

187
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,120
what's concealing a fact

188
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,099
and finally you forgot to write a paper

189
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,599
in school so you write the first page

190
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,699
only you staple it to a bunch of blank

191
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,900
pages you rip off the blank pages and

192
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,979
then you tell your people I don't know

193
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,400
what happened they must have gotten

194
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,960
[ __ ] no that one's just me okay

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
um well that would be concealing

196
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,479
affected and since we're doing this at a

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,740
university I don't endorse this

198
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,479
um but all these different things are

199
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,160
just meant to sort of show how do we

200
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,380
think about concealing and revealing

201
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,759
facts and fiction and as we go on we can

202
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,440
think a little bit more about what does

203
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,660
that look like in fiber

204
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,819
I just want to provide a couple other um

205
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,740
sort of mental models to wrap our brains

206
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,780
around how this could look and what the

207
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,479
usefulness are what the youthfulness is

208
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,199
of some of these things so

209
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,120
um

210
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,699
let's talk about aware of Waldo puzzle

211
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,720
right in Where's Waldo your job if you

212
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,219
haven't seen one of these before right

213
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,140
is to find the little guy with the hat

214
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,580
and I meant to find him before this and

215
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,599
I totally forgot to so he's here

216
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,640
somewhere

217
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,419
um but what makes it really hard to find

218
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,039
Waldo has nothing to do with Waldo and

219
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,899
everything to do with Waldo's

220
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,640
environment right you have the keys to

221
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,260
the kingdom if you will and yet you

222
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,060
still can't find Waldo because there's

223
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,100
all the colors they're similar patterns

224
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,839
there's lots of noise in the same way

225
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,420
when we think about our cyber

226
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,459
environments right now if there's an

227
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,200
intrusion and someone get through all of

228
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,240
our layers of you know defense and depth

229
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,160
and they make it through to have the

230
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,440
keys to the kingdom if you will

231
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,600
um if one right they have access to data

232
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
they have access to you know crown

233
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,500
jewels and critical asset

234
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,959
um but how could we turn the table how

235
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,200
can we bad ambiguity to the environment

236
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,120
make that process of I'm in but I don't

237
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,820
necessarily have a full understanding or

238
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
a full picture easily quickly and how do

239
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,779
I kind of ramp up and adjust that

240
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,100
ambiguity on the flip side there might

241
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,560
also be times where we want to lower

242
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,480
that ambiguity right so if we're setting

243
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,220
up Honeypot or if we're setting up areas

244
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,959
of our Network that we know are highly

245
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,880
monitored or we have suppliers or

246
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,620
whatever it might be then maybe we want

247
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,779
to turn down the ambiguity in those

248
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,459
environments make our adversary feel a

249
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,100
little bit more comfortable like you're

250
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,660
going to go that way lead them towards

251
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,279
the things that don't matter in a way

252
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,019
for nothing to do so we can start

253
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,000
thinking about this as a knob of how do

254
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,740
we increase the ambiguity to protect

255
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,480
what's valuable and decrease the

256
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,360
ambiguity in places that we want to move

257
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,279
the adversary towards

258
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,500
um so here I have two pictures of a park

259
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,140
your job is to get from the side of the

260
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,240
park Iran to the other side of the park

261
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,399
um again I can't actually become any

262
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,839
presentation mode be any hand but um

263
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,220
let's pretend that you guys are raising

264
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,660
him how many people are going to take

265
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,920
the path on the right

266
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,320
and how many people are going to take

267
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,880
the path on the left so

268
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,220
um most times when I can see the

269
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,720
audience uh the answer here is that most

270
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,120
people are going to take

271
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,760
um that path in the left why it's well

272
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,339
lit it has a it has nice clear guide

273
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,920
rails right I can see where I'm going

274
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:36,959
and I feel more comfortable never have I

275
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,000
had someone say I'm going to across the

276
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,380
graph right just the fact that I put a

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,300
path in front of you and said get from

278
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,640
one side to the other most are going to

279
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,380
gravitate towards that path so how do we

280
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,260
again think about that same thing in the

281
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,180
Fiber space how do we create a well-lit

282
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,920
comfortable path so that the adversary

283
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,779
will move in the ways that we want them

284
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,040
to and those are the places that we're

285
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,440
going to again be

286
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,940
um high levels of monitoring we're going

287
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,040
to have tripwires we're going to feel

288
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,140
like we're well defended and make the

289
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,240
places that we we don't want them to go

290
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,860
near our Crown duels or around the

291
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
places that you know that system that's

292
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,399
been on the network for forever and you

293
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,320
know we just can't patch it because it

294
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,240
was made by one manufacturer that is now

295
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,160
out of business and it's critical to our

296
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,480
manufacturing company and I've seen that

297
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,160
happen in the real world

298
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,220
um how do we make that look like the

299
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,380
dark and scary pop and make the the area

300
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,700
that we can defend look like that knife

301
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,800
well lit path

302
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,640
so we'll talk a little bit more now

303
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
about

304
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,579
um now that we have sort of an

305
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,620
understanding of what why we want to do

306
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:36,839
this and what this could look like about

307
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,060
the goals of adversary engagement and

308
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,680
one of the big principles behind miter

309
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,180
engage is that everything needs to be

310
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,680
goal driven

311
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,240
um oftentimes when we're talking to

312
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,399
organizations that are trying to start

313
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,740
using deception or adversary engagement

314
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,480
and we ask why if the answer is

315
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,579
something along the lines of

316
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,720
sounds good it sounds useful it sounds

317
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,700
cool

318
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,380
um and it's not goal driven right if we

319
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,600
think about the history of detection

320
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,120
from a military perspective no military

321
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,040
commander in in history whatever say

322
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,500
they're using deception for deception's

323
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,839
sake deception is always about having a

324
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,519
goal and it's the tool you're using to

325
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,980
get there and so we like to adopt that

326
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,060
same model when it comes to adversary

327
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,160
engagement

328
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,399
so we break things down into three kind

329
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,320
of categories of goals the first one is

330
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,120
we want it with both adversaries that

331
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,279
are already operating on our Network by

332
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,019
triggering High Fidelity alert this is

333
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,700
kind of probably the most obvious use

334
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,260
case of that with their engagement is

335
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,279
where a lot of the vendor space is

336
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,959
playing

337
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,880
um and it's one of the sort of easy

338
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,279
entry points because it kind of it just

339
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,660
makes sense when we think about what

340
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,060
we're trying to do and how we're trying

341
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,100
to do it right you can put deceptive

342
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,079
documents that when you open them we'll

343
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,720
send an alert you could have detective

344
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,600
users or video users on your network but

345
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,180
if someone tried to use a password or

346
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,000
login at that user you get an alert you

347
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,680
can put decoy credentials around

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,540
um around an environment and if one of

349
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,279
those credentials gets you you have a

350
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,380
high fidelity alert right so think about

351
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,880
these different ways that we can have a

352
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,860
high level of confidence that if

353
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,560
something is triggering that alert

354
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,820
something bad is happening

355
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,440
um one of the interesting things there

356
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,600
as well is that even when it's not

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,760
something really bad so for example

358
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,620
those decoy documents are even putting a

359
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,760
decoy Network there so let's say on our

360
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,740
CEO desktop we put a share that says you

361
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,600
know my tax document or something like

362
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,940
that and we have a bunch of what looks

363
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,620
like personal data well even if a

364
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,600
legitimate employee is touching that

365
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,940
chair it still probably warrants the

366
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,820
conversation of why are you snooping

367
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,380
around the CEO's desktop so really

368
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,600
providing us with not just an

369
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,880
understanding of what's bad but also

370
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,700
helping to inform maybe any

371
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,279
um Behavior that's just unwanted

372
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,380
the second one is about affecting an

373
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,540
adversary type of operation in some way

374
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,700
that protects your organization by

375
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,860
either decreasing the damage or scope of

376
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,740
a compromise reducing future targeting

377
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,600
or disrupting malicious operation

378
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,639
to be so personally I think this is

379
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,680
where some of the real power of AdvoCare

380
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,200
engagement lies I think it's an area

381
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,820
that the vendor space is not fully

382
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,560
started playing in yet I think there's

383
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,600
some more advanced folks who are a bit

384
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,579
more mature and are starting to sort of

385
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,800
look at what this would look like in our

386
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,860
networks but we're kind of far the

387
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,019
community from that adoption of using

388
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,620
adversary engagement to do things like

389
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,240
increase ambiguity and environments or

390
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,820
um you know add uncertainty to an

391
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,160
environment or just kind of create noise

392
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,019
and backgrounds in an environment

393
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,880
and finally

394
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,320
um we have a set of goals that involved

395
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,100
a listening intelligence from an

396
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,839
adversary based on your sort of

397
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,100
contextualized timely relevant attack

398
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,360
circuit

399
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,220
um there's a number of different folks I

400
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,440
think are playing in the space typically

401
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,300
this is being done by threat and fell

402
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,180
teams who are not

403
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,560
um kind of involved with the production

404
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,699
networks and production security so this

405
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,620
is typically

406
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,360
um and sort of best practices for the

407
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,019
sort of Intel of the patient to happen

408
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,279
on isolated networks that are either

409
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,779
unattributed From Any Given organization

410
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,220
or potentially look like the

411
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,260
organization that is trying to collect

412
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,779
the threat intelligence there's some

413
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,579
great examples out there of organization

414
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,480
generating threat intelligence in this

415
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,459
way

416
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,620
I think one of the most public examples

417
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:24,240
is HSBC

418
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,160
um has a threat Intel theme and they

419
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,620
spoke at RFA last year

420
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,839
um as well as new con last year

421
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,279
um about their work using fiber

422
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,839
deception and adversary engagement

423
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,839
through illicit threat intelligence

424
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,060
um and this is actually I'll let me go

425
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,500
back a little bit about kind of where

426
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,120
miter got started but it actually

427
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,760
involved this threat intelligent

428
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,220
solicitation Faith so we got started in

429
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,199
adversary engagement about about 10

430
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,060
years ago at this point because we had

431
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,680
too much time spent an indicator from

432
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,320
others that weren't always relevant to

433
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,899
us it was difficult to discover much on

434
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,959
a production Network there was little to

435
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,360
no information on post compromise PCP

436
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,160
tactics techniques and procedures and

437
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,800
there were a few options for post

438
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,540
compromised infinite response so we

439
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,639
started to put a lot of effort into

440
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,500
changing the game and for us adversary

441
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,180
engagement was the way to do that and so

442
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,220
we ran an initial

443
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,199
um adversary engagement operation as a

444
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,060
result of a real compromise and from

445
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,240
that we then started to run a number of

446
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,680
operations for the subsequent years

447
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,959
um in attributed environment

448
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,880
unattributed environment we had a number

449
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,320
of different rigs that we would use in

450
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,699
order to be able to maintain these

451
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,500
operations

452
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,779
um and were able to generate a lot of

453
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,940
really valuable threat religion and so

454
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,440
actually one of our biggest sort of ways

455
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,120
of sharing the threat intelligence out

456
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,399
with the community has been through

457
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,100
attack so obviously today attack is much

458
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,620
bigger than than just accepted but the

459
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,300
initial humble beginnings of attack with

460
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,100
most of that intelligent was coming

461
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,440
through the adversary engagement

462
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,820
operations that miter was running at the

463
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,380
time we weren't talking about doing that

464
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,240
with their engagement and so we were

465
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,380
able to sort of share that information

466
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,939
out through with that without having to

467
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,400
talk about how we were getting that

468
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,780
intelligent through these operations but

469
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,400
that was sort of attack on the Lord

470
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,160
didn't but as I said attack is much

471
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,819
bigger today and has a lot more sources

472
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,679
um than just minor obviously

473
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,360
um but that was that kind of our our

474
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,220
Focus initially was was on threat

475
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,720
intelligent solicitation via adversary

476
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,160
engagement

477
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,500
um but one thing that's really important

478
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,780
to note is that adversary engagement is

479
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,580
not static adversaries change over time

480
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,980
and organization changes over time

481
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,480
Global events change over time and

482
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,299
because of that there's sort of this

483
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,580
wave of where your priorities are so for

484
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,840
example reminders beginning it was

485
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,940
really important for us to understand

486
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,039
what was going on we really needed to be

487
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,440
able to understand that threat landscape

488
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,240
but over time that might change and one

489
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,039
thing that's really important is making

490
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,400
sure that we're kind of constantly

491
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,500
understanding what is my goal today and

492
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,380
how do I make sure that I'm constantly

493
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,940
adapting and adjusting my engagement so

494
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,240
that I'm meeting whatever goal that I

495
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,240
have today

496
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,419
um and one of the things that sort of

497
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,820
this relies on is being the whole thing

498
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,500
as a goal driven process and that was

499
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,940
really the impotence for us developing

500
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
miter engage and wanting to put

501
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,840
something out into the community because

502
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,080
we realized that this is not like other

503
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,760
defense and depth Technologies right so

504
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,960
antivirus EDR you can kind of deploy it

505
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,000
and walk away

506
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,919
and you don't really need to put a lot

507
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,020
of thought into the process or changing

508
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,780
it over time but adversary engagement

509
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,340
does require that you do that and so we

510
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,720
wanted to create miter engage in order

511
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,240
to help with that

512
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,679
so this is the miter engage Matrix and I

513
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,720
have to apologize to everyone if you go

514
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,160
onto our website we just found out there

515
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,140
is an update

516
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,900
um over the weekend that caused a bunch

517
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,580
of our JavaScript break we are fixing it

518
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,380
um all of the data is available and I'll

519
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,480
pop the link in the chat so you can get

520
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,980
the spreadsheet of data and hopefully

521
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,780
very soon we will have all the

522
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,880
JavaScript apparently there was a

523
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,919
back-end change that happened and that

524
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,080
we weren't aware of so it is not

525
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,340
interactive at the moment but

526
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,080
ultimately

527
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,460
ordinarily you can you can go on the

528
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
website and click through all of these

529
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,679
different buckets and read more about

530
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,260
what sort of how we Define that specific

531
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,820
um piece of the Matrix some places where

532
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,799
we've seen references to it and things

533
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,660
like that but for now I Want to Break

534
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,600
Down The Matrix into how this really can

535
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,220
be used as a planning tool so on the end

536
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,620
we have what we talk about is our

537
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,539
strategic action this is what helps us

538
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,580
bookend our operation with strategic

539
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:35,039
planning and Analysis

540
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,559
in the middle we have engagement action

541
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,679
so this is how you're driving progress

542
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,539
towards the defender's strategic goal if

543
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,760
we start slicing the other way across

544
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,679
the top we have goals so these are the

545
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,419
big outcomes you're trying to achieve

546
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,280
and what's really important here is

547
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,200
everything is always viewed downwards

548
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,179
through those goals it really helps us

549
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,140
remember that this is a goal driven

550
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,120
process

551
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,620
one level down from that we that we have

552
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,240
our approaches so that's the main the

553
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,260
means that we by which you're making

554
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
progress

555
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,340
um you can sort of think of this as

556
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,480
analogous to a tactic an attack

557
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,980
um the reason it's just not the word

558
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,900
tactic is that when we're mapping

559
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,700
between a path and

560
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,220
um engage we're not talking about attack

561
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,140
tactics and engage tactics

562
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,360
and then finally one level down from

563
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,799
that we have activities so these are the

564
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,320
concrete technique that you're going to

565
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,240
use to make progress um and to really go

566
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,980
out your approach again this is similar

567
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,320
to a technique but for that same reason

568
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,900
we didn't want to use the same word

569
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,660
each of the activities in the center

570
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,160
um in in the engagement activities and

571
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,020
those are each map

572
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,360
s the way we think about about this is

573
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,179
that when an adversary does something so

574
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,700
pick a given decode and attack there is

575
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,100
some vulnerability that that exposes and

576
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,980
we can take advantage of that through an

577
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,600
Engaged through an Engaged activity so

578
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,200
for example

579
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,360
um fishing is one of the activities in

580
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,380
um sorry one of the technique there you

581
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,240
go I said there are different words and

582
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm still making them a lot

583
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,520
um is one of the techniques in attack

584
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,000
when an adversary conduct fishing

585
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,620
operation they lose control of the yeah

586
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,360
the email that they are sending right if

587
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,400
it's a phishing email they have to send

588
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,960
it into your space they have no idea who

589
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
is on the other end actually clicking it

590
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,320
whether it's a real person whether it's

591
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,299
actually in a production Network

592
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,640
um and so the deception opportunity the

593
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:25,620
engagement opportunity is that you can

594
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,200
use things like lures you can use things

595
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,059
like Persona and so that's how we sort

596
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,159
of think about mapping all of these and

597
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,419
so you'll see on the attack website that

598
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,100
you're sorry on the engagement website

599
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,960
that we have all of these different

600
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,700
things that are all mapped back so you

601
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,860
can start to plan out you know these are

602
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,720
the ecos and attack that I'm most I'm

603
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,799
worried about and here's my engagement

604
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,799
space given that

605
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,500
um one thing to note is that engage is

606
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,539
not meant to be viewed as a finished

607
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,460
product we don't want to tell you how to

608
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:54,900
shrink wrap your engagement operations

609
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,880
because then they're not really going to

610
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,320
be useful for the community what we're

611
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,000
really trying to present is an

612
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,340
deductible set of guide rails to help

613
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,620
the community start the path forward

614
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,559
we have a number of different different

615
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,179
sort of themes of content and again it's

616
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,520
really all starting with our operation

617
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,919
how do we help the community to also

618
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,020
adopt the tech this technology space in

619
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,280
a way that is effective and most

620
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,260
productive

621
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,340
so this is going to be really quick I

622
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,780
just want to share a couple quick

623
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,220
thoughts on the future of adversary

624
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,960
engagement

625
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,360
um the miter as you can see sort of has

626
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,299
had a long history with it as I already

627
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,460
told I talked with part of that for us

628
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,260
we really want to help the community to

629
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,120
better use this technology and we're

630
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,340
really spending a lot of time and focus

631
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,679
on kind of helping this get out into the

632
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,419
public and and helping other folks be

633
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,320
able to use the technology that we used

634
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,320
for a long time

635
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,020
um for us we think that you know fiber

636
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,640
Avenue their never-ending stream and we

637
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,400
really do need

638
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,380
a killer companies below the fiber

639
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,059
poverty line are in real trouble and

640
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,100
their insecurities if everyone's

641
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,100
insecurity

642
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,140
um and threat intelligence threat to

643
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,820
intellectual property uh and critical

644
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,919
infrastructure right level of national

645
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,080
security threat

646
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,460
nope I just lost my little book you

647
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
think there we go

648
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,700
um and really ultimately we want to know

649
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,340
how do we look at the different problems

650
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,840
helping small companies helping um sort

651
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,460
of with direct intellectual property and

652
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,440
critical infrastructure and overall

653
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,720
drive up the cost while driving down the

654
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,880
value of adversary fiber operations and

655
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,740
this is really the focus for engage

656
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,840
um in the years to come

657
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,340
so we hypothesized that we can scale

658
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,659
this with collaboration and we really

659
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,220
believe that that's what's most

660
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,840
important we have a number of things

661
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,520
that we're doing to try to Foster that

662
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,860
collaboration this being a great example

663
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,840
of it today but we really want to help

664
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,840
though how do we go from adversary

665
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,059
engagement at an individual organization

666
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,400
maybe even looking at what this looks

667
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,320
like when a whole industry is

668
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,640
um participating in adverse or

669
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,600
engagement and you're really having

670
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,580
those

671
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,679
um more tailored and kind of

672
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,539
campaign-like structures so that you can

673
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,039
really help protect not just the

674
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,380
organizations that are able to do this

675
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,360
but all the different organizations the

676
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,980
craft and Industry that's a quick little

677
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,559
sneak peek of some of the things that

678
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,500
engage in thinking about right now and

679
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,200
the last thing I'll end on is we are

680
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,840
um about to have sort of our first set

681
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,120
of beta runs of our engaged in a box

682
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,500
this is a non-technical train the

683
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,179
trainer kit designed to help

684
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,740
organizations think differently about

685
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,320
adversary engagement who will actually

686
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,460
be at RFA in a couple weeks with one of

687
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,080
these get to talk about what we're

688
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,720
trying to do and it's really to help

689
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,580
more organizations be able to start

690
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,740
participating in using this technology

691
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,299
and to start thinking about how we can

692
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,340
make this kind of a more strategic

693
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:43,919
action that we can participate in to

694
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,360
help secure our our company our critical

695
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,740
infrastructure and our intellectual

696
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,780
property

697
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,640
um and with that I will I think I've

698
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,559
used up all my time so I will hand it

699
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,559
over back to I apologies

700
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,299
I think

701
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,299
for me

702
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:09,960
I hope everyone can hear me now I'm I'd

703
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,380
like to thank you merita this is a

704
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,940
wonderful presentation we are holding q

705
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:20,460
and aim for the end of the seminar uh at

706
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:24,960
this point I would like to ask for it

707
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:27,960
all the publicly for uh the Cyber domain

708
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,080
ontology project to join us

709
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,080

taking the time to talk to everybody

732
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,059
about the adversary engagement work that

733
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,440
you're doing so I hope everybody you

734
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,480
know was able to learn some things there

735
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,039
uh make sure that you prepare a lot of

736
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,380
questions from Loretta you know so

737
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,960
um again thanks for the opportunity to

738
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,340
come here to University of New Haven

739
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,260
um it's always a pleasure to come here

740
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,200
and work with the faculty and students

741
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,539
on different projects so straight to be

742
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,720
back thank you for hosting it and

743
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:45,299
and so today I I wanted to share a

744
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,500
couple remarks about an open source

745
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:50,480
project that I'm

746
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,480
a cyber lonely on polishing project

747
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,460
that's just a little bit about me I work

748
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:58,620
in the Meyer corporations and a

749
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,179
non-profit organization that supports

750
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,120
our federal government

751
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:06,360
and I uh one of the roles that I have

752
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,980
there is I'm a project leader of miter's

753
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,140
work at the Department of Defense cyber

754
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,000
crime Center so I appreciate my

755
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,860
colleagues from the dod cybercrime

756
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,840
Center and from this and for Meyer

757
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,000
joining us today online

758
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,980
and uh so a couple of things I've got

759
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,340
work experience across the cycle domain

760
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,440
uh just over 20 years of experience and

761
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:29,100
one of the things that I do uh in part

762
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,559
time is I I run a volunteer technologist

763
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,980
team at watching International which

764
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,419
creates Technologies for law enforcement

765
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,059
investigators around the world to

766
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:42,240
investigate crimes against children and

767
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:44,640
then finally I get the honor to serve as

768
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,919
the project chair for the Linux

769
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,320
foundation's cyber domain on College

770
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,320
projects

771
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,059
right so um Baseline everybody when we

772
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,700
talk about ontologies the monitor

773
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,919
Frameworks for representing shareable

774
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,140
and reusable knowledge across the domain

775
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,640
so like in the Cyber domain here like

776
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,580
just show a hands how many people work

777
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,340
in the Cyber domain are learning domain

778
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,020
okay pretty much everybody now the

779
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,140
problem is is the Cyber domain is very

780
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,840
Broad and I would argue that there are

781
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,600
at least several dozen different areas

782
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,299
of practice within the Cyber domain and

783
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,059
within each of those areas

784
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:26,279
we have our own unique language so maybe

785
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:28,140
like average of Engagement

786
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,360
uh even right at her team that are

787
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,279
working adversary engagement they still

788
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,559
get to borrow from

789
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:37,200
you know from a language of thousands of

790
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,440
Concepts that most cyber practitioners

791
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,840
would agree upon but then Within action

792
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:47,880
there's a specific language that's

793
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,220
formed to other uh uh other experts in

794
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,799
other areas of the Cyber domain

795
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,200
and so what design we're going oncology

796
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,480
project is all about is developing a

797
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,159
family of ideologies

798
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
um and so I'm going to talk about some

799
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,799
of these uh but some of these

800
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,720
non-publishers include what we call the

801
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,559
unified cyber oncology because our

802
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,200
middle oncology the case ontology is our

803
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:13,580
additional forensics oncology and then

804
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,580
today the team here at the University

805
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,720
okay so let's let's think about this in

806
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,760
a different way

807
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,460
um everybody here speaks English

808
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,159
now how many of you have traveled abroad

809
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:33,600
to other countries where English is also

810
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:37,679
been okay most of us right so when you

811
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,720
go from from the United States to the UK

812
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,940
there's a lot of shared language

813
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,679
Concepts or you can walk into a bar and

814
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,940
you can have a great conversation with

815
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,740
them

816
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,860
but somewhere in that conversation

817
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,200
they're going to start talking about

818
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,659
Concepts that you have no idea about

819
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,100
and so they may say something like oh

820
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:57,200
hey you know I'm gonna go back to my

821
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,580
flights

822
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,039
what the heck is a flag

823
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,779
and you have to you know you have to

824
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:05,100
maybe ask for some clarification you've

825
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,679
never heard that well in the United

826
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,840
States that's not perfect right and so I

827
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,059
got a list of of those like different

828
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,140
concepts and this is the same problem

829
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,140
that we have of course

830
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,179
now I wonder if you know like a specific

831
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:25,340
example here here on on this side we

832
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:27,779
thought uh the left area

833
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,659
as the fact of the cycle operations

834
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,279
maybe like Network designs uh and then

835
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:33,720
we got digital forensics on the other

836
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,580
side the thing about like legal

837
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,360
processes

838
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:41,159
and in both of these uh in both of these

839
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,740
areas I was just saying that there are

840
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,080
two two different organizations

841
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,159
um they may both employ visual forensic

842
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,980
examiners

843
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,919
so on the left hand side when you're

844
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,899
trying to detect and respond to

845
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,460
incidents at your local forensic

846
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,480
examiner is going to go through and

847
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,220
they're going to say something like hey

848
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,559
it's forensics they're running instant

849
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,899
response here's what I found I think

850
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,460
something illegal happened here they're

851
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,020
gonna go to their bosses into their

852
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,000
legal counsel and I'm going to say maybe

853
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,380
we should try to like probably you know

854
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,820
get some good government to help

855
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,500
prosecute this

856
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,880
and so they call that local police

857
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,679
department the local police department

858
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,320
sends their digital forensics and family

859
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,419
and they say oh hey you know well I need

860
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,220
to acquire forensic images from the

861
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,320
company I need to use my tools and

862
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,360
processes and basically knew everything

863
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,360
that you already did plus a little bit

864
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,039
more so give me all of your data

865
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,820
um and everything that I can do has to

866
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,179
be

867
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:39,360
legally offensive one repeal

868
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:41,240
uh because their work is going to lead

869
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,440
possibly the courtroom and testimony

870
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,299
which will then hopefully lead to

871
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,179
prosecution

872
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:51,140
and so even though forensic examiners we

873
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:55,200
work across these two they still operate

874
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:57,899
uh under uh different concepts and

875
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,320
different process

876
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:04,559
so when we go back to thinking about

877
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,019
these uh this cyber domain of discourse

878
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,359
the language that we all see

879
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:12,599
there's a lot of shares I were doing

880
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,040
Concepts thousands of effects

881
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,540
and then we've got these unique

882
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,700
applications

883
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,560
I'm going to go out adversary engagement

884
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,359
about digital forensics think about

885
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,099
instant response

886
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,379
and so those communities are

887
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:30,060
practitioners have to inherit the

888
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:32,220
concepts from the shared domain

889
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,940
so let me pull this out a little bit

890
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,099
more

891
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,740
so I mentioned one of the anthologies

892
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:40,200
that is is within the Cyber domain

893
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,940
oncology project is called the unified

894
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,080
cyber ontology

895
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:49,560
this is our project's middle oncology so

896
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:53,339
this is where we express and document

897
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:56,040
let's just say 80 of the concepts in the

898
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:58,320
Cyber domain of discourse and so these

899
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,180
are Concepts like a file

900
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,060
an IP address

901
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,800
and many many many more

902
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,619
and

903
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,400
um those things are what we call

904
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:11,460
observables

905
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,940
now there's a number of other Concepts

906
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:19,579
in here like a location or the concept

907
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:22,859
of a pattern of a cool invigoration

908
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:25,560
of data marketing we've assessed that

909
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,800
all of these Concepts up here are

910
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,500
something or they're Concepts that are

911
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:34,760
agree upon no matter what area of the

912
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,760
Cyber domain you work in

913
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:43,160
they can inherit these Concepts and then

914
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,160
reuse them in adverse navigation

915
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:49,680
so I want to just highlight you know a

916
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:53,640
few other application specific domains

917
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,740
just kind of show you how quickly we can

918
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,619
start to understand all these different

919
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,200
areas of practice within cyber so I

920
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,660
mentioned digital forensics the original

921
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,820
project science we have with the case on

922
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,800
policy for that and today we're going to

923
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,900
hear about the adversary engagement or

924
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,220
your denial Inception but there's all

925
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,680
these other things like cyber threat

926
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,260
intelligence power analysis advisors

927
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,900
management automating wallability

928
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,300
research defensive cyber operations and

929
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,400
on and on and on and on

930
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,579
so what we're trying to do here is a

931
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,560
cyber building ontology project is to

932
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:30,780
identify

933
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,540
uh practitioners

934
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,660
in each of these areas and then work

935
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,740
with them over time this this is like

936
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,320
over the years

937
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:43,980
to identify

938
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:47,460
the practitioners to make sure that

939
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,140
there's at least a small industry and

940
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,780
that there's some agreement about the

941
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:55,079
about the taxonomy or the language that

942
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:57,300
they use within that sub domain and then

943
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,640
we organize them and we invite them to

944
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,720
come under the cyber building oncology

945
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:06,240
umbrella and we start to documents and

946
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,300
that's exactly what we did was engaged

947
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,300
and we started with Beretta and her

948
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,720
team's work over many many years and

949
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,880
their collaborations with many

950
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,240
researchers vendors and practitioners

951
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,280
and they finally said hey we've got

952
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,200
engaged it's it's a it's a it's a

953
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,599
taxonomy at the end of the day that

954
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,300
expresses all those leading Concepts

955
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,440
and so we said well maybe it's time that

956
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:37,859
we can Implement an application oncology

957
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:41,820
that inherits from the universe

958
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:43,980
and so the point is a different way

959
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,780
we have the unified cyber ontology to

960
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,780
start middle oncology

961
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,540
and application oncology so they inherit

962
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,619
these common Concepts from the UCO

963
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:57,359
and uh and then when we look at the

964
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,619
application oncologies these are the

965
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,599
things that were that we're working

966
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:02,579
towards right now we've got one for

967
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:06,720
digital forensics this is key the case

968
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:10,260
ontology we have a brand new one uh for

969
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,480
uh deception and average that's an

970
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,980
aeonology and a couple of the things

971
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,320
that we're working on behind the scenes

972
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,460
were supply chain risk cyber threat

973
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,339
intelligence

974
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:24,900
so now we're also working to bring on

975
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:26,880
board another uh group from Asia who's

976
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,200
working on an oncology for pharmacy

977
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,540
hours

978
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,099
now we oftentimes will run into

979
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,920
organizations

980
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,500
where they say well you know this is

981
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,619
great and everything but I've got some

982
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,440
Concepts that I don't want to put in

983
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:44,940
Poland here uh for whatever reason it

984
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,640
could be proprietary or national

985
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,400
security related and the great thing

986
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,079
about this architecture with this with

987
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,780
the middle domain ontology and

988
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,520
application anthologies is that you can

989
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,280
very easily create your own application

990
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,500
oncology which inherits from the middle

991
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,440
oncology and then you can also borrow

992
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,359
from all the public Concepts in the

993
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,200
published application on colleges that

994
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:09,540
we have

995
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,079
uh so where is this where is this

996
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:17,820
leading right so so we want this project

997
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:19,380
to help the entire industry right so so

998
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,440
um I've got these gold lines up here

999
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,200
that help us sort of think through

1000
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,960
um the the mission integration between

1001
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,300
these different areas of cyber security

1002
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,520
practice so let's just start with supply

1003
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,880
chain risk I guess it's up to the buy

1004
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,859
chain risk is is looking and saying hey

1005
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,079
um yeah I'm building something I'm

1006
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,359
delivering something there's business

1007
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,980
process

1008
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,920
and perhaps there's a cyber

1009
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,579
vulnerability to somewhere in there well

1010
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,200
we didn't know about that and we made

1011
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:54,900
hopefully more humidity back that

1012
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,940
mitigation May cost a lot of money

1013
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,060
okay so it's not maybe something that

1014
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,020
you can go do immediately so in that

1015
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,619
regard

1016
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,940
uh the fact of the vulnerability is

1017
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:09,119
probably something that you want to

1018
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:13,200
protect or you want to deny that facts

1019
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:16,020
from an adversary Now where's that that

1020
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,740
brings an opportunity for a cyber denial

1021
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,740
operation

1022
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,079
alert then leads to well guess what

1023
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:35,339
cyber threat intelligence about the

1024
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,599
adversary

1025
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:41,700
uh it also provides an opportunity for

1026
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,040
digital forensics okay for digital

1027
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,660
transition instant response and all the

1028
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,520
legal process and all the stuff that

1029
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,619
we're talking about and a digital

1030
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,280
forensics that provides a technical

1031
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:55,140
evidence that informs anonymous

1032
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,240
right so in the real world these

1033
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,160
practitioners have to work together

1034
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,839
but for them to work together more

1035
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,900
efficiently to interoper in the future

1036
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:06,359
at all their tools and the processor

1037
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,820
operate we have to have this organized

1038
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:12,720
cyber building of discourse and that's

1039
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,240
how the ability law school together here

1040
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,280
all right and then uh this is an open

1041
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,920
source project it's really important

1042
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,320
that we have Community contributions

1043
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,800
that we have good governance and

1044
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,800
processes

1045
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:33,480
under the Linux foundation with three

1046
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,460
different uh committees number one we

1047
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,320
have a project steering committee which

1048
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,140
I have the honor of serving as the chair

1049
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,180
for and I following Alex Nelson this

1050
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,380
audience he's also a member of this area

1051
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,320
committee

1052
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,060
uh we have the ontology committee and

1053
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,220
then we have an option

1054
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,079
and so these are fairly straightforward

1055
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,960
names to help us kind of understand the

1056
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,460
purposes uh but the Syrian committee is

1057
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,200
really about kind of providing that

1058
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,180
tactical governance

1059
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,740
um it's what interacts with the Linux

1060
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,900
foundations that's the Strategic

1061
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:06,359
Direction organizes resources and

1062
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,660
manages providing life cycles

1063
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:11,579
depending on politics that committee is

1064
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,339
about adjudicating and implementing

1065
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:17,280
changes to all of the project

1066
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:19,380
oncologists uh it meets monthly for

1067
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,720
oncology engineering reviews provides

1068
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,280
project software and documentation and

1069
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,320
then lastly there's the adoption today

1070
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,900
and the adoption committee works with

1071
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,700
oncology at the doctors worldwide so if

1072
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,099
you have a product or research effort

1073
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,500
underway you could reach out to the

1074
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,780
adoption committee and say hey like did

1075
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:41,579
you have some automation for me to

1076
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:43,140
validate my UCL Json absolutely and so

1077
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:45,060
we can point that to you

1078
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,520
um you could also contribute your

1079
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:50,660
research outputs or your open resource

1080
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,660
tools to the adoption today

1081
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,599
you have a really simple process in

1082
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,940
GitHub uh for you to submit a change

1083
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,859
request and that will go to the ontology

1084
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,920
committee the Anthology Community will

1085
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:07,980
generally very quickly respond and make

1086
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:11,579
sure that the concepts that you need are

1087
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:14,640
then uh put into the oncology in a way

1088
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:16,500
um that is is that is or has been

1089
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,920
reviewed probably by all of the

1090
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,920
stakeholders

1091
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:23,040
so

1092
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,240
um one of the things that's important

1093
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,339
here is to be able to start with a new

1094
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,640
effort to say like the adversary

1095
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:33,839
engagement on apology

1096
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,880
you know when we think about granuary

1097
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,300
apology we need to put it through a

1098
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,619
maturity process

1099
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,000
and and

1100
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,099
um so we've been thinking a lot about

1101
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,940
this and

1102
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:48,839
um

1103
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,880
so so the maturity model that we have uh

1104
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:53,240
this that's uh

1105
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,300
uh

1106
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:00,020
near uh but we're getting ready to to

1107
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,020
present this

1108
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:17,579
foreigntology effort in a certain area

1109
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:19,740
uh within cyber and I want to include my

1110
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:22,440
little application oncology within the

1111
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,900
family of oncologists okay you know I'm

1112
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,380
going to come now you're going to make

1113
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,700
us aware of your project and you know

1114
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,500
eventually you know you become a

1115
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,480
candidate project and then eventually

1116
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,339
you'll move through this with maturity

1117
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,920
model being an approved project a

1118
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,420
validated project a formally managed

1119
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,800
project and then a formal government

1120
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,339
project

1121
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,980
and so this allows uh like research

1122
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:50,280
teams or online college games certain

1123
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,319
companies uh to propose and then they

1124
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,319
can move as fast as they want through

1125
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,980
the process uh but but this is this is

1126
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:01,680
uh this is a way to for for us to be

1127
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,020
able to engage with the world and then

1128
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,420
on board these applications oncology

1129
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:10,200
efforts

1130
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:13,680
right so there's a couple of other

1131
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:16,440
things that are unfortunate here

1132
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,500
um in terms of of some ongoing

1133
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:23,839
contributions so we have several large

1134
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,839
digital multimedia forensic extenders

1135
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:30,720
uh we have uh

1136
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,660
very very soon

1137
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,780
um we have a UCO graph Exchange Server

1138
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,339
and so this will uh this will be a tool

1139
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,280
that you can download from GitHub and

1140
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:43,520
you can upload uh your answer engage

1141
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,520
with oncology uh

1142
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,859
represented in in Json LP and This

1143
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,260
Server will basically let you upload it

1144
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:54,000
and set through and query it and

1145
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,859
validate it

1146
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,140
um there's some other uh some other

1147
00:45:55,859 --> 00:46:00,180
significant efforts that are going on uh

1148
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,640
the Netherlands forensics Institute they

1149
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,920
have a digital forensics as a service

1150
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,800
platform

1151
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,880
um and so they have been working through

1152
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,980
case UCL adoption and we've got some

1153
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,460
open source pools autopsy and network

1154
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:20,040
minor that we've been working with uh

1155
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,020
and so they have some initial adoptions

1156
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,540
and so those are tools that you may

1157
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,400
encounter reviews in an academic setting

1158
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,780
you know the forensics lab

1159
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,640
and then there's some various student

1160
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,920
government agencies that are that are

1161
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,920
also looking at the options like

1162
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
um

1163
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:40,920
so finally this is my last slide we have

1164
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:44,099
some product resources if you want to

1165
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,859
come visit the project on internet uh

1166
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:49,380
we're at the Cyber domain oncology.org

1167
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:52,920
and that will point you to the unified

1168
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,500
cyber oncology our middle ontology and

1169
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,480
then it will also point you to the app

1170
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,300
the published application oncology so

1171
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,980
the case oncology and the adversary

1172
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,599
engagement technology

1173
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,040
so with that

1174
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,440
um I think we're gonna hold questions to

1175
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,920
the very end but again thank you so much

1176
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,079
for having me here today to talk and uh

1177
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,420
the turn it over and out to the heat so

1178
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,839
that he and his team can talk about the

1179
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,839
adversary

1180
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,960
that was a very enlightening

1181
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:31,319
presentation uh both in terms of the

1182
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:36,119
vision of the bullet for the roadmap now

1183
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:37,260
before we move on to the uh to the

1184
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,020
address engagement ontology

1185
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,859
representation overview

1186
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,339
um

1187
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:48,660
Alex Nelson from Nest has ultimately

1188
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:52,800
agreed to present a brief uh statements

1189
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,900
introduction overview of his and college

1190
00:47:52,800 --> 00:48:00,540
involvement in the project

1191
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:03,300
Alex was wondering if you were able to

1192
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,280
uh

1193
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,560
share me are you still on the call I see

1194

College of Engineering

1233
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,280
uh we

1234
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:31,680
uh work on research projects at the

1235
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,060
intersection of cyber security

1236

the team that has been working on

1240
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:52,380
developing at the same data applications

1241
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:58,140
is because two of my doctoral students

1242
00:50:52,380 --> 00:51:00,480
uh Nancy of Piazza and David and we also

1243
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,640
have Ronnie scorpon undergraduate

1244
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,380
research assistant

1245
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:10,880
who has been contributing to this effort

1246
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,880
uh since its Inception

1247
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,859
professor of computer science and data

1248
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,079
science and I'm also the principal

1249
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:21,000
investigator of Salem at the University

1250
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,520
of New Haven

1251
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,760
and I would like to

1252
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:30,180
return the microphone to my wonderful

1253
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:34,460
team to present more of a new uh their

1254
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,460
project please welcome the team

1255
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:42,319
thank you to provide hello everyone

1256
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,319
um

1257
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,660
so let's get started so today what I'm

1258
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,660
doing to you about anniversary

1259
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:57,440
investment applications

1260
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,440
so

1261
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,800
so this is

1262
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:03,800
adoptability fan organic

1263
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,140
indicator for the motivation and

1264
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,420
objectives behind them and refrigerator

1265
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,000
that all the Rosie and the next is going

1266
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,220
to cover the aeel's design and an

1267
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,339
example of how we can make best use of

1268
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,339
it

1269
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,400
okay so what is anniversary reasoning

1270
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,059
for we are just part of the condition

1271
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,339
from the American language

1272
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:31,619
uh explanation

1273
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:33,839
so we want to understand how we can

1274
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:37,500
interact and respond to the administry

1275
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:39,240
in the network so in the abolition way

1276
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,640
you can use addressing this might

1277
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,339
require an operation using denial and

1278
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,280
techniques we can monitor any valid

1279
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:50,540
sources of energy operations and the

1280
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,540
goal here is to

1281
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:56,579
how we can actually increase the amount

1282
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,740
of operation and decrease the value of

1283
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:01,619
their overall operations right and for

1284
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:05,940
that we can use the relevant Frameworks

1285
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:05,940
of that minor attack we succeeds

1286
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,319
now we have that Frameworks in place but

1287
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,839
how can we represent this concept in

1288
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:19,220
terms of rock right and this is where

1289
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,220
address three engagement

1290
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:24,980
now what is addressing this

1291
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,980
it is

1292
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,319
focuses on defining and its memorizing

1293
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:36,660
the information preposition of adversary

1294
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:39,660
investment and decide

1295
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,660
and

1296
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,700
these are the very forces we should

1297
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,220
write the overall process of that

1298
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:50,040
surround study we also want to improve

1299
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:52,680
the consistency applying a operations

1300
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,680
and we want to make sure that the

1301
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,960
evacuation process and communication uh

1302
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:01,319
with defects stakeholders and actors

1303
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:04,520
various Stones is very seamless enemies

1304
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:04,520
and because of that

1305
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,920
foreign

1306
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,400
right and because of that it contributes

1307
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,160
to the ease and consistency of

1308
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,900
integrated data force uh between across

1309
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,000
the very sermon a cyber operation and it

1310
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,880
also helps in the seamless uh a

1311
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,220
operation configurations

1312
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,140
so ideally we should be able to repair

1313
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,359
that all the concepts are used for

1314
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:42,180
accuracy in this thing but we are

1315
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,940
limited uh and we right now what we have

1316
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,859
done is we have uh we were able to

1317
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:49,099
represent the concept from the existing

1318
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:49,099
address

1319
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:55,040
and also the necessary Concepts from

1320
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,040
like that framework uh

1321
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:03,000
so the correct list that we have is uh

1322
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:06,599
we just released our current data

1323
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,059
version of a Euro percent 0.1.8 and it's

1324
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:11,160
already in the kicked up and we'll be

1325
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:15,119
looking forward to make more changes and

1326
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:18,480
release the uh more stable and uh with

1327
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,599
the property Works in a few months

1328
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,599
um

1329
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:27,559
to describe the models in uh design and

1330
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:31,500
process thank you

1331
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:33,780
hi everyone I'm Nancy I'm a PhD PhD

1332
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:36,440
student at this lab I work as primarily

1333
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:39,359
on mobile agents

1334
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,579
systems um so me right here we have an

1335
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,319
anthology overview this diagram here is

1336
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,359
really going to help us see an idea of

1337
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:46,800
the purpose of certain classes or

1338
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,240
concepts

1339
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,099
um and where they flow and why we

1340
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,099
introduce them but we'll break it down

1341
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,720
so ideally right as an anthology we have

1342
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,700
the actual structure of an ecology where

1343
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,099
we have the namespace the name space is

1344
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,140
commonly proposed of basically by the

1345
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:06,839
namespaces we have the attack which

1346
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:09,500
referrals to Concepts from Attack

1347
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,500
Frameworks

1348
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,900
foreign

1349
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,819
we have the pre-pro learning ideas and

1350
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,160
Concepts things that we really establish

1351
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:06,839
or if you create a plan uh three

1352
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,119
ingredient plants and events and plan

1353
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:10,740
events together and then of course we

1354
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,720
have the things that populate them which

1355
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,359
are the perception of objects of cells

1356
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,280
and maybe some operational things the

1357
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,619
things

1358
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:22,079
are more or less like the ideas

1359
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:23,880
exclusively absolutely even you probably

1360
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,980
wouldn't find them anywhere else most

1361
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,380
likely right but the other ones are not

1362
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,579
cool maybe Concepts that might overlap

1363
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,220
with other

1364
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:35,040
um uh domains right so then we need to

1365
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,960
really think about when to depreciate

1366
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,099
those Concepts later on or when it kind

1367
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,940
of

1368
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:43,680
so please rewinding concepts are are

1369
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,079
designed to support the starting minor

1370
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,839
engaged headset process for 80 like a

1371
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:51,240
graph right so I either need to use this

1372
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:53,359
repair we reference the entire process

1373
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,380
of planning like the entire processary

1374
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,380
operational ordinary effects

1375
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,140
so expanding the second most important

1376
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:05,880
uh

1377
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,280
Japanese space there's really only one

1378
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,020
actual class in the same space it's all

1379
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,720
objective all the rest of them are

1380
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:15,119
instances of objectives and specifically

1381
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,240
why we just outline very specifically

1382
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:21,960
lighter attacks and minor engages

1383
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,420
um uh tactics and higher level goals

1384
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,220
um which we use actually

1385
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,140
and then of course we cover a little bit

1386
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:30,059
of other things which can be considered

1387
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,680
like things that are not necessarily get

1388
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:34,020
covered by minor or they could be

1389
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,260
exactly that uh we link two of them

1390
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,260
together

1391
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:46,740
then we have obviously making sure we

1392
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,799
have identity in general so identity uh

1393
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:52,559
under the UCO identity right they have

1394
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:54,599
uh they basically inherit their their

1395
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,520
class for that and we considered

1396
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:58,920
something called the Persona and a team

1397
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,720
so Persona we usually just decided as a

1398
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,380
separation of concepts of identities or

1399
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:06,359
real identities

1400
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,200
of people actually are who they're

1401
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:08,819
asking

1402
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,200
right

1403
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:12,780
um and then we have a concept of a team

1404
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,180
so ideally in uco's identity they have

1405
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:17,640
an organization but we really want to

1406
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:19,619
specify the meal a subset of people who

1407
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:22,640
actually interact directly and

1408
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:22,640
coordinate foreign

1409
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,400
the purple team those are all just

1410
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:44,000
okay so moving on uh we talked about

1411
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:44,000
exclusive lineatology

1412
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:50,339
of a positive quality and now we need to

1413
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:54,180
talk about the usages and the intentions

1414
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:56,160
of wider and such designs and mostly and

1415
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:59,339
the best way they can really give you an

1416
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:02,099
idea why is divided into phases of when

1417
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:03,359
you when you process information this is

1418
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,040
the pre-operation phase like the

1419
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,380
pre-planning phase interoperation days

1420
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,240
when during an operation during time

1421
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,980
what was actually happening and why are

1422
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,859
you modeling and impulse operation which

1423
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:16,079
is more or less the analysis

1424
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:18,180
so

1425
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,740
the pre-operation and implying of an

1426
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:22,319
operation is important to be able to

1427
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:24,720
start to represent right this is kind of

1428
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:27,420
like uh your first blueprint you know

1429
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,220
and so it's one of the tools that we

1430
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,200
have here from the planning segment on

1431
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,839
the need engage right we need to express

1432
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,280
a sequence of events plan events

1433
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,319
together

1434
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,900
um that relate to some sort of ordering

1435
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:42,119
of expectation of how a particular uh

1436
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,099
operation is going to go right so we

1437
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,920
need to see we need to be realistic um

1438
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:49,500
and have actual concrete discussions of

1439
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,540
how of our expectations and we need to

1440
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,980
expect to development of resources prior

1441
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,140
to an operation

1442
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:57,480
so the narrative concepts are there

1443
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,400
really support this for this um

1444
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:02,460
intra operation

1445
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:05,280
um it occurs during an operation so

1446
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,500
before it comes after the pre-planning

1447
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,599
and during when an operation X is

1448
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,500
actually run into its termination so

1449
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,240
that's what we really call

1450
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,280
interoperation

1451
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,960
there are some things during planning

1452
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,240
right um when you plan things like if

1453
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,160
you have an actor in a particular

1454
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,200
environment right by Defender has active

1455
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:25,020
persona it's not something you can

1456
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:27,059
deploy before the operation right it's

1457
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:31,140
actually somebody who actually interacts

1458
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:31,140
during an operation information

1459
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,900
will probably come from data sources for

1460
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:57,839
monitoring logging right so when you

1461
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,220
monitor a particular network activity

1462
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,119
right you might be able to have other

1463
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,520
information

1464
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:04,500
so it's usually there to help you get an

1465
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,299
idea of what exhibitions can you expect

1466
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,579
for certain phases of what the

1467
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:11,119
permissions look at the information down

1468
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:11,119
the properties

1469
01:02:12,299 --> 01:02:16,740
right and then finally there's post

1470
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,000
operation right we really addressed

1471
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:19,440
pre-operation in

1472
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,420
the pre-planning major operation

1473
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,280
Concepts and we are exposed there so we

1474
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,260
have generation however post operations

1475
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,460
are also very complex

1476
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,380
right

1477
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,579
um post operation phase and unsettable

1478
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,799
usages

1479
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:34,260
namely like directly that we address we

1480
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:37,140
address minority we just understand

1481
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,880
um right and so that's kind of more or

1482
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,680
less a starting the process of the

1483
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,720
processing information

1484
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,180
um reducing information and then

1485
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,859
including up with a new plan for

1486
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:48,599
reiteration right but then it's also

1487
01:02:46,859 --> 01:02:50,099
identifying when modifications or

1488
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:52,339
Corrections are made to build a timeline

1489
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,339
evidence

1490
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,180
closet

1491
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,059
um we are currently going to quote for

1492
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:11,339
supporting evaluation and measurement of

1493
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:14,339
interoperation measurements test so

1494
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:15,660
during an actual measured right is there

1495
01:03:14,339 --> 01:03:17,520
a measure that you can take during

1496
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,940
measure to determine how well your

1497
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,940
operations

1498
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,180
so more or less right you have a plan

1499
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,680
and then you start uh

1500
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,640
you perform the operated and then you

1501
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,640
align your that's together

1502
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,799
okay and then finally the best part of

1503
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,740
this um to really enumerate how you can

1504
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:42,440
use apps on

1505
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:45,839
ology

1506
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,339
so of course um mentioned this home

1507
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,740
alone but we all mentioned it again

1508
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:52,500
because it really is a good example of

1509
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:54,720
how it is and the

1510
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,460
um you know a Labyrinth of many little

1511
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,920
booty chats

1512
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,660
um so obviously the idea is if you can

1513
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,180
see that battle plan that came and wrote

1514
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:04,500
up right and in some way right it's a

1515
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,359
blueprint it's basically kind of like

1516
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,559
the concept The Narrative except maybe a

1517
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:09,480
little bit more information he doesn't

1518
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:12,059
really tell you the secret events that

1519
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,520
he expects to happen but a lot of that's

1520
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:16,920
actually really important to encode in

1521
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,240
during the planning place right and then

1522
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:22,079
of course we have this little senior

1523
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,460
word yeah people dancing pretend to give

1524
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,440
it a perception and there are people

1525
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,839
living and being Lively in the house

1526
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,579
even though there was none so right a

1527
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:32,280
lot of Engagement depends on something

1528
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:35,220
perception which is really important to

1529
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,559
actually identify in an intelligence

1530
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:39,480
okay so here specifically we're going to

1531
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:42,240
call ourselves uh we have a company

1532
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,579
called mineral R Us right

1533
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:47,700
so we're a small yet critical rare herb

1534
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:49,440
Mining Company in New Hampshire

1535
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,240
our main clients are from the critical

1536
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,160
infrastructure technology in the events

1537
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,440
Industries

1538
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,359
our key intellectual properties and

1539
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,880
operational procedures are stored on

1540
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:01,500
paper

1541
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,119
fashion and this is only known by

1542
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,280
celebrity

1543
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,140
but we do have a small unorganized

1544
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,240
computer network but only generic

1545
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:11,579
security infrastructure we have every

1546
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:15,079
small team that operates uh that

1547
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:15,079
contains operational Technologies

1548
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,559
and we just received an advisory notice

1549
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:21,660
some of the federal authorities that

1550
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:26,000
there are rapidly growing cyber threats

1551
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:29,520
as acknowledged by state sponsored apts

1552
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,260
that are more frequently

1553
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,720
um so in response right your company

1554
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,099
decides to engage an external type of

1555
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,440
security provided to a certain way

1556
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:39,960
timely incident response and prevention

1557
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,960
the external provider recommends the

1558
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,339
employment

1559
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:47,160
and asks you to develop a high level

1560
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:48,660
deception and denominable strategy

1561
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,940
so

1562
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:52,680
mentioning that a little bit from at a

1563
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:55,559
certain engagement we pull from this

1564
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:58,440
very useful tool the back depiction uh

1565
01:05:55,559 --> 01:06:00,599
the nylon deception Matrix right so we

1566
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:04,020
have path along the column side we have

1567
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:08,059
the perception techniques uh deception

1568
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:08,059
and denial type is on the

1569
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:16,020
so the idea here is is like here so over

1570
01:06:13,319 --> 01:06:18,660
here a fact you know that we have what

1571
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,520
we want to reveal is the network is in

1572
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,260
New Hampshire the business runs a mine

1573
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:24,299
in New Hampshire so that's more or less

1574
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,520
something being covered and so that we

1575
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:28,500
want them to confirm so that they feel a

1576
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,660
little more uh secure in their

1577
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,700
assumptions then maybe for a position

1578
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,160
that we want to tell them or reveal to

1579
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:37,140
them right is that we have low value

1580
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,380
intellectual properties stored on the

1581
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:40,380
network right

1582
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,079
and then we have the slack which is for

1583
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:48,299
the concealing like the things that we

1584
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,339
want to we want to conceal form

1585
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:51,240
Anonymous series of things that we want

1586
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,460
to protect we have a business

1587
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,740
relationship with strategic Partners

1588
01:06:53,460 --> 01:07:00,000
have a minerals money from the Strategic

1589
01:06:55,740 --> 01:07:01,920
Partners uh process reminding uh that is

1590
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,780
essential to them right and the amounts

1591
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,700
of mineral minds all that information as

1592
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,680
well as like the company's location

1593
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:09,359
saying passcodes

1594
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,740
um or anything like that right so those

1595
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:13,500
are really good things we really want to

1596
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:15,480
connect and then for the fiction uh that

1597
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:18,720
we want to quote conceal we want percent

1598
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:20,099
uh we want the conceal is that most

1599
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,839
important intellectual property is

1600
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:23,839
located in this specific location

1601
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,079
so

1602
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,700
we have a Serial engagement all the

1603
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:34,619
improvised structure needed to transform

1604
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:37,440
your abstract deception concept plan

1605
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,119
into representation the degree of how

1606
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,099
being still your narrative will depend

1607
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,859
on how extensively refined you want to

1608
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:46,200
be opportunity planning to be right so

1609
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:48,000
you may come out with this 100 page the

1610
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,859
century plan all written and lots of

1611
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,480
paragraphs and words and a lot of detail

1612
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:53,640
right but now you need to conversions

1613
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,680
and sometimes you might realize hey I'm

1614
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,740
actually missing some information

1615
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,740
um

1616
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,100
so this is more or less dependent on how

1617
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:36,120
much resources you're willing to put out

1618
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:39,380
uh right and if it's not right then you

1619
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,380
repeat until you're satisfied

1620
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:45,179
so to start off right first thing we do

1621
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:47,460
is we create a narrative The Narrative

1622
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:48,719
is just kind of like your discussion

1623
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:50,580
campaign

1624
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,500
um so you are a lot so you're able to

1625
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:54,299
actually distinguish the differences

1626
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,219
between a plan and the rest of the unit

1627
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:58,080
right so then you create your plan

1628
01:08:56,219 --> 01:09:00,000
events there's one specifically has two

1629
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,620
plan events and you can kind of see the

1630
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,900
relationship one comes first the next

1631
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:06,179
comes after right so the storyline Falls

1632
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:09,600
the structure of the museum acts threads

1633
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:13,080
to The Chronic parsley organ sets

1634
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,179
so if we expand the first line events at

1635
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,799
the center we have an action so this is

1636
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,060
basically like the evidence that you

1637
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:20,339
action right

1638
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,660
um what we call actions is it action and

1639
01:09:20,339 --> 01:09:23,759
then this action has very specific

1640
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:25,799
properties that inherits a uco's action

1641
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,480
is such as like the performer the

1642
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:29,040
objects

1643
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,900
um maybe even like the environment and

1644
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,460
those kind of things so the performer of

1645
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,859
the deploy action is this particular

1646
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:37,620
person and then what do they deploy what

1647
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:40,080
object to manipulate they deployed

1648
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:42,540
and so there's a very specific

1649
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,819
um special property which is called has

1650
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:47,699
characterization which links up the

1651
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:50,100
concepts right the concept of AE so the

1652
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:52,500
physical world of what observables are

1653
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,620
supposed to represent so this Honeypot

1654
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:58,020
is going to be you know on an actual

1655
01:09:55,620 --> 01:10:00,179
system a maybe a device and it's going

1656
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:02,699
to have this particular running server

1657
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:04,560
operating system or so forth right and

1658
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:06,600
so those alert objects like what does it

1659
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,699
actually look like it actually the

1660
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:11,340
characterization of it is actually a PDF

1661
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:13,620
or their oscillated thoughts

1662
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,600
so this relationship can be built out

1663
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:17,460
right so this plan that moral is just

1664
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,920
told you that a person that deployed a

1665
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:21,300
bunch of deception objects

1666
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:23,580
files the configuration of the data

1667
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,960
sources so the second thing that

1668
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:27,179
happened in this particular event is

1669
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,000
that uh this person deployed right

1670
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:31,320
another data source system for setting

1671
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,960
up like you know this security

1672
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:36,179
monitoring

1673
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,440
then comes the second event so we expand

1674
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:38,820
the second event they all kind of

1675
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,640
language so you can get the operations

1676
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:43,800
right it describes a scenario which

1677
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,080
follows the first planned event

1678
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,659
um

1679
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:50,940
and then we have the canary token is a

1680
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:52,860
server data source did they Source alert

1681
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:55,400
so it's got certain files of access on

1682
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,400
or off to them

1683
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:20,940
and then this is just literally just an

1684
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,340
overview of how it looks together

1685
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:25,620
it's kind of release

1686
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:27,000
technically but uh if you start putting

1687
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:29,179
all the arrows in right then it'd be

1688
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,179
starting

1689
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,420
so

1690
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,780
um one of the most important

1691
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:38,760
um usage of an intology is to query uh

1692
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,840
from the graph information but what kind

1693
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,780
of information can we get from

1694
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,400
standardization process for example

1695
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:46,400
let's just load into

1696
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,400
um

1697
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:56,580
so maybe I have a question I want to

1698
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,440
know about how many deception objects

1699
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:01,920
were instantiated with a particular

1700
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:04,260
objective which is Consulting well you

1701
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,600
can tell me too why because actually

1702
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:10,280
there's only two also be a scary

1703
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,280
thoughts right there being um

1704
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:22,800
so the Honeypot and maybe the files

1705
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,480
right then we have direct and we have a

1706
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,480
sculpture those are the two options

1707
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,480
right

1708
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:34,500
um May provide some Logistics that will

1709
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:36,840
not immutable impairment phrase right

1710
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:38,640
maybe you want to diversify or narrow

1711
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,739
the deception techniques depending on

1712
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:43,500
the type of adversary you expect right

1713
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:45,780
so maybe report adversaries in your wine

1714
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:48,540
or Niche right a very particular

1715
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:49,380
purposes for certain types of

1716
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:52,440
um

1717
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:55,199
um actions right or certain types of

1718
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,300
um right so therefore maybe you want to

1719
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:59,340
eat a dangerous plant where Sun Fighters

1720
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:03,000
your spread

1721
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:04,920
um your AE objective goals right

1722
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,420
um to really cover and be more a little

1723
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,900
bit more resilient towards those

1724
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:11,760
specific kinds of attacks

1725
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:14,760
and then future developments

1726
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:18,179
intelligence we have

1727
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:21,600
so challenges are as followed right as a

1728
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:23,040
as an application oncology right uh we

1729
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,320
need to stay compliant with them at all

1730
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,600
times at least under official versions

1731
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,060
and their full versions right so that's

1732
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,739
really important sometimes UCO has some

1733
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,679
big structural changes that also will

1734
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:36,420
change ourselves uh we work for

1735
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:39,500
facilitating students and options of

1736
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,500
current tools and techniques

1737
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:48,239
then we have to pick and choose which

1738
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,100
Concepts that overlay between domains

1739
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:51,960
and figure out who gets to own that

1740
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:54,179
concept and who really should become

1741
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,820
responsibility of it right and you may

1742
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:59,280
need to possibly conflict Resolute uh

1743
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:02,100
Concepts when they are so for example a

1744
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:04,500
lot of things we borrowed from CTI

1745
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:07,140
um you know leave this there and live

1746
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:09,300
there but we may want to use them

1747
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,620
and of course we want the game to be

1748
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:13,100
compatible with other relevant

1749
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,100
applications

1750
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:21,840
um this is where you can find uh our

1751
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,179
particular repository uh where you plan

1752
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,280
your ecology for what sign is equal we

1753
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:28,860
support uh if you want to contribute you

1754
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,760
can also contact those this year

1755
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:33,420
um

1756
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:36,060
and then we did a small little uh test

1757
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:38,460
thank you according for uh showing this

1758
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:40,620
um we asked dbt4 about what information

1759
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:44,540
could it gather by giving it just to

1760
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:44,540
Json LD format right

1761
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:54,719
is very very smart about

1762
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,580
um describing some of the things that

1763
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:59,400
are concentrated right so objective

1764
01:14:56,580 --> 01:15:01,679
storyline events it's a really good idea

1765
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:04,140
of what we're trying to present in this

1766
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,640
Json something is wrong but

1767
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,920
um it's a really interesting thought

1768
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:12,199
that you know you could be promised even

1769
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,199
just by uh publishing or anyone

1770
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,400
and so these are the contributors are

1771
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:19,320
still up and then from the minor team

1772
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,840
that a lot of input of them which is

1773
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,699
extremely helpful we were Guided by a

1774
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,219
lot of people on the miter teams of the

1775
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:30,060
direction for you based on Direction

1776
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:33,020
so I also and I like any questions

1777
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,020
thank you very much

1778
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:41,460
wonderful presentation I'm going to open

1779
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:44,040
the floor to what uh questions from the

1780
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:46,500
audience but before doing this I just

1781
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,380
wanted to add something to the very last

1782
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:53,040
slide that you had before the relative

1783
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:55,140
page on the GBP board sample so last

1784
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:59,400
night I had a little bit of trouble uh

1785
01:15:55,140 --> 01:16:01,679
sleeping I got to play around with gpt4

1786
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:03,300
and our ontology

1787
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,980
now that's

1788
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,580
well

1789
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:13,440
um gpt4 in the channel

1790
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:17,100
or Chad gbt 3.5 has seen this example of

1791
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:18,960
Json lb you can then ask it to convert

1792
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:21,360
the textual description

1793
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,640
into a Json and that's one of the things

1794
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:28,560
that we are going to explore as

1795
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:32,040
one application or at least uh one uh

1796
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:35,159
tool that is built on top of this work

1797
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:38,760
there's the scope of utilization

1798
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:42,360
adoption and expansion and extensions

1799
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:44,340
quite wide and large and promising

1800
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,140
particularly when it comes to automation

1801
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:49,860
with that I would like to thank you

1802
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:52,679
again and I would like to open the for

1803
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:54,659
the questions from the audience if you

1804
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:56,760
are online please feel free to raise

1805
01:16:54,659 --> 01:16:58,620
your hand if you are in person

1806
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:02,520
uh

1807
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:04,140
praise your political actual and and the

1808
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,199
questions are not necessarily have to be

1809
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:09,719
limited to the final presentation

1810
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:13,380
uh I believe whereas and Alex are still

1811
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:16,040
with us employees with us in the bedroom

1812
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,040
so

1813
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:22,860
the

1814
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:24,960
while you're waiting for questions I can

1815
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:27,179
go first

1816
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,179
so

1817
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:29,179
um

1818
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:34,080
in the industry the cyber security

1819
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:36,960
industry

1820
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:39,960
who and what sort of

1821
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,560
development or service provider to be

1822
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:46,100
able to immediately the

1823
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,100
AE application

1824
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:52,320
um so primarily right one of our

1825
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:54,840
particular Department Of Interest or our

1826
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:57,000
new audiences is basically the creators

1827
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:01,100
the managers of the studying technology

1828
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,100
so there are a bunch of vendors

1829
01:18:04,219 --> 01:18:08,940
which produce uh these you know

1830
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,280
handy-dandy tool tips for deception

1831
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:13,340
Operating Officer engagement right it'd

1832
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:16,140
be really useful for them to add support

1833
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:18,980
to exporting their information from

1834
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:21,719
their systems into some representations

1835
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:23,520
and that might be really useful for one

1836
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:25,560
transplant information over to other

1837
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,540
departments and other people have other

1838
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,980
businesses to analyze in that data the

1839
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,980
two also keeps standardized

1840
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:37,860
Asian and CM

1841
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,679
do we have any questions from the online

1842
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:43,040
audience we are watching your camera

1843
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,040
view

1844
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,659
like this you've done such a great job

1845
01:18:55,199 --> 01:19:00,719
in exactly your work you are absolutely

1846
01:18:57,659 --> 01:19:04,580
so I'm going to ask another question to

1847
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,580
get the ball rolling I'm sorry again

1848
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:11,159
even to me who's been involved in uh the

1849
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:12,360
development

1850
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:14,880
um

1851
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:19,679
so I remember we had to go through

1852
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:23,820
multiple revisions uh our design for

1853
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:26,540
hematology classes and so on

1854
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,540
if

1855
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:35,159
um what are the major concerns in terms

1856
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:38,219
of the calming provisions and their

1857
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:41,100
alignment and compatibility with UCO

1858
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:43,980
if you think the user Community should

1859
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:47,360
be aware managing on ions

1860
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,360
um from what I know

1861
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:54,179
proposal are going to be implemented or

1862
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,580
are on sale or some of the properties

1863
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:58,699
are going to full cover

1864
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,699
um

1865
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:04,920
it's going to cover some other Concepts

1866
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:07,199
that we they initially had alternative

1867
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:10,860
for but then we had to remove it because

1868
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:13,140
it would probably the design process or

1869
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:15,900
integrated use

1870
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:19,140
um so it really depends we kind of

1871
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:23,520
standardize our productology based on

1872
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:25,920
UCO 1.00 version right and so we want to

1873
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,540
keep that main support from that if they

1874
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,460
you still come out with another visual

1875
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:31,500
version of Standard Version or something

1876
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:35,420
like that they will have to go back and

1877
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:38,340
revise that didn't come up um

1878
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:40,620
still use the first version right but be

1879
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:45,560
aware that so many differences when you

1880
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:45,560
try to use a newer version of you so

1881
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:57,000
thank you

1882
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:59,219
still new questions can we keep going I

1883
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,120
have menu

1884
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:05,580
uh if somebody respond to that um

1885
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,500
hi uh folks Nelson again

1886
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:09,060
um speaking on my roles UCL ontology

1887
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,739
committee chair

1888
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:14,460
um

1889
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:17,580
when UCO released its 1.0 version back

1890
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:20,580
in uh I think it was September of last

1891
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:22,620
year uh we made a commitment to follow

1892
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:25,080
semantic versioning uh specifically

1893
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:27,060
September 2.0 uh you can see it's

1894
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:29,460
semper.org

1895
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:32,400
um that commitment is that we will not

1896
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:36,540
introduce backwards incompatible changes

1897
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:38,520
until the next major release and by

1898
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:40,920
operational Rhythm that release was

1899
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,719
going to be planned for if we were in a

1900
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,960
crunch and found something horrible six

1901
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:49,199
months uh that'll be about next week

1902
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:51,600
um we are not finding such a an urgent

1903
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:55,440
need for a 2.0 right now so we are

1904
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:58,739
planning at around a year uh we would do

1905
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,719
um our first uh 2.0 release introducing

1906
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:03,960
backwards incompatible changes so

1907
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:07,080
anything that you see in version 1.0 or

1908
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,900
1.1 so on right now or 1.2 coming out in

1909
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:13,020
the next couple weeks um anything you

1910
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:15,480
see in there will still work with uh

1911
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:18,620
shackle validation uh so the conformance

1912
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:21,480
checking system until our 2.0 release

1913
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:24,179
and with our first backwards and

1914
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:27,120
compatible change set after the December

1915
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:29,580
1.0 release we'll have like a discussion

1916
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:31,679
among the ontology committee uh we're

1917
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:33,420
going to flag something as a warning

1918
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:35,159
when do we start flagging as an error

1919
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,320
we've had some people say we need a year

1920
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:39,540
for our engineering teams uh before you

1921
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:42,179
say it's an outright error

1922
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:43,800
um that kind of feedback is what we look

1923
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:47,520
forward to getting from the community as

1924
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:49,500
we plan for our Tour release uh so uh

1925
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,739
ants if there is something that comes in

1926
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:55,080
as a potential new feature it might step

1927
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:56,699
on your toes uh because you said I

1928
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,620
really wanted that but if it's available

1929
01:22:56,699 --> 01:23:01,380
in UCO it's available to the broader

1930
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:03,600
application space as well so

1931
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:06,420
um it's actually someone to be benefited

1932
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:09,420
to have something uh implemented further

1933
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:11,699
Upstream uh for availability purposes uh

1934
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:14,100
but if we do get something that does

1935
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:15,540
look like it's in the middle layer

1936
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,980
instead of the application layer it's

1937
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:20,300
good to know that we're actually meeting

1938
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:20,300
the application where the needs

1939
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:25,920
go ahead

1940
01:23:23,219 --> 01:23:28,080
uh good I was being concur with this

1941
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,179
Sean Barnum sorry with miter um also

1942
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,520
heavily involved throughout founding UCL

1943
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:35,159
a lot of the stuff with CDO and have

1944
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:37,260
been working closely with uh vaheed and

1945
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:38,580
I think all the rest of the team on the

1946
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:40,199
AEO stuff

1947
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,699
um I agree with Alex completely as far

1948
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:44,340
as the the semantic versioning and major

1949
01:23:41,699 --> 01:23:47,699
changes to UCO causing big changes up

1950
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:49,679
into AEO I I would suspect it's likely

1951
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:51,300
the changes that ACO that might triple

1952
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:54,659
are probably going to be more along the

1953
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:57,360
lines of some of the concepts that don't

1954
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:59,940
currently exist in UCO but likely should

1955
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,920
for AEO and other Pros doing so the

1956
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,060
concept is objective that's something

1957
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,679
that's needed by lots of different

1958
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:07,199
application domains but it's not there

1959
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:09,360
right now so AEO has defined it

1960
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,500
internally right now there's things like

1961
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,840
that there's some of the things that

1962
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,600
will be part of the CTI applications I

1963
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,179
mean ontology and that could uh

1964
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:20,159
submitted in as just like a CEO is so

1965
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:22,380
it'll likely be things like that that

1966
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:24,600
when there is the more natural place for

1967
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:26,760
that concept to be defined either in UCO

1968
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,820
or a different application ontology it

1969
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:32,219
would be simply a matter of within AEO

1970
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:33,780
can still deal with that concept it's

1971
01:24:32,219 --> 01:24:35,760
primarily its namespace that would

1972
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:37,739
change so right so the namespace for

1973
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:41,940
that concept you would just reference it

1974
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:43,500
from UCO references from like CTI and it

1975
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:45,659
shouldn't structurally change anything

1976
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,940
but it would probably cause a little bit

1977
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:49,620
of a ripple up on hey well now you guys

1978
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:52,080
you know ADM no longer has to worry

1979
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:53,280
about being the native uh Keeper of the

1980
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,020
torch for one of those things that

1981
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,880
really primarily belongs somewhere else

1982
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:58,500
you would be able to reference and use

1983
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,840
it from somewhere else I think that's

1984
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:03,000
likely to be more of the changes that

1985
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:05,219
triple up rather than anything big

1986
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,040
structural UCO stuff like like Alex was

1987
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:09,659
saying where the governance is trying to

1988
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,980
keep those thanks to a minimum right

1989
01:25:09,659 --> 01:25:13,080
especially as more application of

1990
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:15,840
manitologies come in those sorts of

1991
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,640
ripples become ways very quickly so the

1992
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,040
government in this process is very much

1993
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:22,640
intended to minimize that

1994
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,640
foreign

1995
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:44,040
one of the things that you should

1996
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:45,840
consider is joining you know kind of

1997
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:48,900
like joining one of these open source

1998
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:51,420
projects it doesn't have to be cyber

1999
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:53,640
domeology project although a little

2000
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:55,020
biased maybe you should

2001
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:57,600
um but you know while you're in school

2002
01:25:55,020 --> 01:26:01,440
and you're studying uh for four six

2003
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:04,560
eight years maybe more sometimes it's

2004
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:07,139
good to get out and take part in these

2005
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,000
these efforts where you can collaborate

2006
01:26:07,139 --> 01:26:11,219
and you can learn new things you can

2007
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,920
apply the skills that you're learning

2008
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:16,620
here in the University it also gives you

2009
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,719
the ability to meet lots of people from

2010
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:20,400
you know from industry made by mentors

2011
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,199
there you may find Future employers

2012
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,760
there you may find Future technical

2013
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:26,520
collaborators there

2014
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:29,580
and and so you know over the years uh

2015
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:32,340
with the with this ongoing engagement uh

2016
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:34,260
with with the University of New Haven uh

2017
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:36,840
we've actually had a number of students

2018
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:39,960
over the years from UNH having

2019
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:41,639
participate in this in this open source

2020
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,520
community

2021
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:45,780
um so the the offer is still open for

2022

um well

2027
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:59,400

proposals as they come in

2036
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:29,219
um and uh and there's a myriad of other

2037
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:31,560
of other things and so that's not what

2038
01:27:29,219 --> 01:27:34,199
you saw today if you see something in an

2039
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:36,179
interview like hey I'm really interested

2040
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:38,219
in that one thing Corey talked about I

2041
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:39,360
mean it's talked about what I'm ready to

2042
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:41,580
talk about

2043
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:44,940
just raise your hand and say hey I'd

2044
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:46,980
like to maybe give one hour a month you

2045
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:48,480
know to volunteer for this or two hours

2046
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:50,699
long or something

2047
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,219
um you certainly can work that with with

2048
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:58,100
your faculty members uh to maybe

2049
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:58,100
incorporate that into uh Focus study

2050
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:09,480
um and also if you're interested in

2051
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:13,260
contributing uh or or helping recruit

2052
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:15,960
other oncology efforts uh that you might

2053
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:18,600
know about to come enjoy December uh we

2054
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,000
certainly would but would welcome that

2055
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:22,920
uh so just a concept but if anyone have

2056
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,639
any questions about that sort of thing

2057
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:26,060
about how you might be able to

2058
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:26,060
participate

2059
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:30,739
no

2060
01:28:32,179 --> 01:28:38,940
no uh the Linux Foundation uh projects

2061
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:42,000
are completely open to the entire world

2062
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:42,780
so no matter who you are where you come

2063
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,320
from

2064
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:49,860
uh you're more than welcome uh

2065
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:52,139
one of the I would say you should at

2066
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:53,219
least be a fairly conversant English

2067
01:28:52,139 --> 01:28:55,500
language

2068
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:57,060
uh that's that's probably about the only

2069
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:00,060
requirement just because the rest of the

2070
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:02,699
community operates within English

2071
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:06,800
language but but outside of that they're

2072
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:06,800
really hard no hard requirements

2073
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:12,900
in wonderful Avenue of opportunities to

2074
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,639
explore and thank you for that great

2075
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:16,620
right

2076
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:20,159
um I believe there are no other

2077
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:22,980
questions so I can't I can't explain

2078
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:24,540
myself I need to ask one more

2079
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:27,480
